# GoodChat App
GoodChat is an omni-channel chat solution that enables users to donate to us using their channel of choice (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, LINE, etc.). 

This repository is for GoodChat App which is a hybrid app that provides a user interface that allows our staff to communicate with donors as well as generate structured transactions out of these interactions in order to integrate with our existing systems.
